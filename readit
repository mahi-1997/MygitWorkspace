Here I'm trying to lear different git command
1. git init
   To initialise a repository
2. git status
   Show status of current repo
3. git add <filename>
   To add file to commit
4. git rm --cached <file>
   To remove file from staged area but it will be not deleted from Local repo
5. git rm -f <file>
   Remove completly from local also
